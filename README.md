## Overview
CAVe-Lite is the smaller version of CAVe-in-a-Box. CAVe-Lite is meant to be used in a classroom setting to teach and demonstrate
the network connections and message flow for SAE J2735 messages. This script will allow for a SPaT (Signal Phase and Timing) message to 
be translated from a pre-recorded Traffic Signal Controller (NTCIP 1202) message. The SPaT Message is broadcast to the network the 
Raspberry Pi is connected to. A traffic light and CARMA 1-Tenth or CAVe-Mobile vehicle are used to demonstrate how SAE J2735 Messages can be used. 

Instructions for downloading and using CAVe-Mobile can be found in the cave-mobile folder.

The attached NTCIP 1202 cycle contains the following signal phases:
Green state = 15 seconds
Yellow state = 3 seconds
Red state = Green + Yellow + 2 second all phases red (20 seconds)
